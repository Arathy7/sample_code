EXPERIMENTS
1.	Calculate The Area of a Built Up Space and A Small Parcel of Land by Distance Meter and by Measuring Tape
2.	Transfer The Level from One Point to Another Using a Water Level.
3.	Construct One and A Half Brick Thick Wall Using English Bond
4.	Estimate The Number of Different Types of Building Blocks to Construct a Wall

STUDY
1.	Study of Tools
2.	Study On Rain Water Harvesting Installation

26/07/2021, 12:04 pm - Anagha Anne: Dear students,
Following instructions are to be followed strictly while writing your Electrical Engineering Workshop Record.
1. Buy an unruled long note book (A4 size) as the record book.
2. Do all the writings ( aim, tools required, materials required, procedure, precautions) on the right side pages of the record.
3. All the layout diagrams, wiring diagrams & switching sequence tables on the left side pages of the record.
4. Do all the drawings neatly using pen ( blue/black) and scale. Don't do free hand drawings.
5. There are some study experiments ( Expt No:1,2,3) which you need to take a photocopy or print out (one side) and paste each sheets on the right side pages of your record. 
6. You have to start writing from Expt No: 4 onwards and have to leave sufficient number of pages for pasting the study experiments. Make sure that you are pasting each sheets of those experiments on a fesh page and not as a bulk.
7. Explanation of the circuits and estimation of wiring materials will be done when we have the contact class. 

If you have any doubt regarding these, feel free to contact your faculty in charge for the workshop.
